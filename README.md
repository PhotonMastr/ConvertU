<h1>One of my first ever real python projects. This will be updated and expanded</h1>
I don't really code in python and I only really learned it recently. Now I know and I really wish I knew earlier. Learn python if you haven't already.

<h1>HOW TO RUN</h1>
Maybe in the future ill make an installer of sort for it but for now it's just a run from command line thing

If you want to run this on your own computer and don't know how for some reason Install python if it's not already installed (https://python.org/downloads) (INSTALL PYTHON 3 AND UP) Then just go in mac terminal, windows powershell, or any linux terminal of your choice and type python3 and then the path to the file e.g python3 /home/YOURNAME/Downloads/ConvertU.py/ and it should work (linux filesystem example)
